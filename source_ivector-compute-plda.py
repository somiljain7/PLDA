# Found this code over internet from the output of ivector-compute-plda.cc
This code assumes that the mean and covariance matrices, PLDA model, and i-vectors have been saved to text files. The code loads these files into numpy arrays and then computes the scores for each class using the formula score = (ivector - mean) * precision * mean. The scores are then printed to the console.

Note that this code is only a starting point and may need to be modified depending on the specific use case and the format of the input data. It is also worth noting that the ivector-compute-plda.cc code is written in C++ and is not directly translatable to Python. This code snippet only provides a way to interpret the output of the C++ code using Python.
